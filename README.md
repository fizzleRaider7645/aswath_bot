I want to create a cli application that leverages gpt 4, current and historical stock prices, earnings reports, as well as finincial news and social media buzz. I also want the ai analysis to leverage analysis of Aswath Damodaran. I want to be able to leverage a local database to query analysis and use previous analysis to determine of to improve in the future. Basically my personal Aswath bot that will also teach me/recommend stocks to buy, time horizons, exit strategies, etc.
